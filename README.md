# DerekBanasC_SharpTutorial_2_WpfApp1

These are my personal notes from the  WPF & XAML, SQL tutorials, starting from the 19th tutorial, to the 25th tutorial,  by Derek Banas starting here:

I had to make these tutorials separately from the main tutorial, because the type of required VS main components, where different from the ones used
in the first 18 tutorials.  

The files where created here, so if you want the original files, you can use the git, to access them, instead of the copies of them, that are in
the numbered tutorial folder.  The only exception, is the 25 tutorial, which required its own project, to accommodate the SQL, which required a program.cs
file, which wasn't part of the other tutorials, in this group.

I'm sure there are plenty of spelling and other syntax errors, in the explanations and comments, but the code has all been tested, and works.  I added
this, and many other tutorials to my Github account, as proof of completion, of these tutorials, for my use in a resume, and as a learning tool,
to learn how to use Github, and its integration within Visual Studio.

My thanks to Derek Banas, for all the tutorials.  He is the author of the tutorials, and therefore, in my eyes, the proprietor of the rules governing
the use of this information.  Since the tutorials where free, I assume these pages can be shared, freely.
